Rammstein is German metal band formed in Berlin in 1994. The band members have remained unchanged throughout their existence. Rammstein has achieved particular fame for their over-the-top stage show, making such extensive use of pyrotechnics that fans eventually coined the motto "Other bands play, Rammstein burns!" Lindemann is even a licensed pyrotechnician and has suffered multiple burns on his ears, head and arms.
